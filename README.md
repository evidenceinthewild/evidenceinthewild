I build statistical design tools and provide consulting services for clinical trials, specializing in oncology and adaptive designs.

## About

I spent nearly a decade as a biostatistician at **Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center** and **SWOG**, specializing in oncology trial design and Phase II adaptive designs.

During that time, I identified recurring failure patterns: *protocols locked in before anyone stress-tested the assumptions, interim decisions made on gut instead of simulation, sample sizes calculated once and never revisited.* I call these "Zombie Trials"—studies continuing enrollment after mathematical evidence suggested stopping.

I founded **Evidence in the Wild** and **Zetyra** on the belief that **the most expensive experiment is the one that was doomed from the start.**

**What drives my work:**
- Building [Zetyra](https://zetyra.com): the tool I wished I had, combining rigorous validated methods with a modern interface that doesn't require a PhD to operate
- Providing honest consulting through [Evidence in the Wild](https://evidenceinthewild.com) on trial design before teams invest millions
- Democratizing statistical tools traditionally locked behind $5,000-$15,000/year enterprise paywalls

Beyond work, I train for Ironman and marathon competitions. Pacing matters in both athletics and trial design.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Web-First:** Browser-based, shareable designs without installation barriers
- **Collaborative:** Project-based workflow with scenario comparison and professional reporting
- **Transparent:** Visible methodology using industry-standard, peer-reviewed packages (gsDesign, SciPy)

## Evidence in the Wild

[Evidence in the Wild](https://evidenceinthewild.com) provides specialized consulting services for clinical trial statistical design.

### Services

**Protocol Statistical Review**
- Evaluate draft protocols to identify design flaws before expensive development phases
- Review sample size assumptions, endpoint selection, and interim analysis strategies
- Typical turnaround: 1-2 weeks

**Sample Size & Power Consultation**
- Justified sample sizing for grants, protocols, and regulatory submissions
- Covariate adjustment strategies (CUPED, ANCOVA)
- Adaptive design feasibility assessment
- Simulation-based operating characteristics

**Adaptive Design Feasibility**
- Honest assessment of whether adaptive designs warrant operational complexity
- Statistical efficiency tradeoff analysis
- Implementation roadmap for complex designs

**Interim Analysis & Futility Planning**
- Design interim looks and stopping rules before trial launch
- Bayesian predictive power calculations
- Alpha spending frameworks (O'Brien-Fleming, Pocock)
- Futility boundary design

### Who I Work With

- **Early-stage biotech** (Series A/B) needing statistical design expertise
- **Academic investigators** pursuing R01 grants or cooperative group proposals
- **CROs** requiring independent statistical review
- **Medical device companies** building biometrics infrastructure

### What I Don't Do

I focus on high-level trial design. I don't provide hourly SAS programming, data cleaning services, or tutoring.

## Zetyra

[**Zetyra**](https://zetyra.com) is a web-based statistical software platform democratizing efficient clinical trial design.

Phase III oncology trials average **$50-100M** and take **4-6 years** to complete. Conservative design practices inflate costs by ignoring baseline correlations, using fixed-sample designs without interim monitoring, and applying frequentist methods for early-stage decisions. Traditional tools (PASS, nQuery) cost **$5,000-$15,000/year** per seat with no validation transparency.

**Core Methodologies:**

• **CUPED** - 15-35% sample size reduction using baseline-outcome correlations (FDA-endorsed)

• **Group Sequential Design** - 15-40% expected sample size reduction with interim monitoring (validated against gsDesign R package)

• **Bayesian Predictive Power** - Quantitative go/no-go decisions using interim data (aligns with FDA draft guidance)

**Features:** Free tier with all calculators, project management, PDF export, 51 automated tests, transparent validation
